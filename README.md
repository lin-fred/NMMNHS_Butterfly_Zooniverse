# NMMNHS Butterfly Project
Files for transcribing, coding and editing data for donations of Butterflies at the New Mexico Museum of Natural History and Science (NMMNHS) Bioscience. These butterflies are donated by Ernest Giese. Data is uplaoded to the database Arctos. Images of each specimens are taken and then uploaded into Zooniverse. Data is then downloaded and ran through a python script to parse out data. It is then edited and standardized for upload into Arctos. Once data is in Arctos, lower resolution images are attached to the records. Full image resolutions can be requested by contacting the collection manager, Lindsey Frederick, at Lindsey.Frederick@state.dca.gov.
